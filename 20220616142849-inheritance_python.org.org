#+author: lordaris
Classes can inherit methods or properties from other classes.
It's purpose is to reuse code.
There are child classes (subclasses or derived classes) and parent classes (base or superclasses)

#+begin_src python
    # inheritance syntax
  class ChildClass(ParentClass):
      #methods and attributes
#+end_src

by default, all classes have the class object as their parent. 

#+begin_src python
  class SomeClass(object):
  # It's the same. 
  class SomeClass: 
#+end_src
