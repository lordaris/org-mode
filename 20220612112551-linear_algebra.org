Study of vecors and certain rules to manipulate them,.

Vectors are special objects that can be added together and multiplied by scalars to produce another object of the same kind.

1. Geometric vectors: directed segments which can be drawn. Two geometric vectors $\vec{x}$, $\vec{y}$ can be added, such that $\vec{x} + \vec{y} = \vec{z}$ is another geometric vector.
   Interpreting vectors as geometric vectors enables us to use our intuitions about direction and magnitude to reason about mathematical operations.
2. Polynomials are instanes of vectors. Very different from geometric vectors. Abstract concepts.
3. Audio signals are vectors. Represented as series of numbers.
4. Elements of $\mathbb{R}$
